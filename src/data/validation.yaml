      - Why are the bot's replies always so significantly delayed? I really needed an answer much more quickly than that.
      - Momconnect definitely seems to have the wrong estimated due date for my current pregnancy in its system!
      - I asked a very straightforward and simple question, and the MomConnect bot gave me a totally confusing and completely unrelated answer back.
      - Please can you stop Momconnect from automatically sending me the exact same generic and unhelpful message repeatedly every few hours?
      - Your current automated chatbot system is not at all helpful or suitable for my specific personal situation or my complex queries.
      - I definitely didn't receive the important reminder for my scheduled 20 week scan from Momconnect this week; what exactly went wrong there?
      - The detailed information that the MomConnect bot provided to me about [specific topic like newborn feeding] seems to be quite incorrect or very outdated.
      - I'm quite frustrated and annoyed today because Momconnect doesn't appear to be working correctly or responding at all.
      - Why can't I just easily speak to a human advisor or a real person for help? This MomConnect bot is clearly not helping me with my problem at all.
      - The MomConnect chatbot completely misunderstood my very clear and simple question about local clinic visiting hours and policies.
      - I'm still waiting for a proper and useful response from MomConnect to my important query that I sent yesterday afternoon already.
      - Your MomConnect system must have somehow calculated my EDD (Estimated Due Date) incorrectly based on the accurate info I initially provided.
      - These generic pre-programmed automated responses from the MomConnect bot are simply not good enough or adequate for dealing with complex health issues.
      - I sometimes don't understand the messages the Momconnect bot sends me at all; they are not always clear or easy for me to follow.
      - Aniyiphenduli ngendlela efanelekileyo yonke imibuzo yami ebhalulekileyo nina baseMomconnect.
      - Imiyalezo yenu yaseMomconnect iyadida kakhulu ngamanye amaxesha kwaye ayincedi ngalutho olubonakalayo ebantwini abayifumanayo.
      - Andonelisekanga neze neze ngawe weMomconnect chatbot, awupenduli imibuzo yam ngendlela echanekileyo necacileyo.
      - Still no useful or relevant answer from Momconnect to my specific question about the local clinic's current opening hours on a Saturday morning.
      - The bot gave me some generic health advice that directly and concerningly contradicted what my own personal doctor previously told me about my condition.
      - This MomConnect bot is just senselessly repeating the same unhelpful things back to me over and over again without understanding.
      - Your AI system clearly doesn't get what I'm actually asking for or trying to communicate to it.
      - I desperately need some real help right now, but this particular bot is not working for me at all effectively.
      - I think I got the wrong information from the Momconnect service again this week regarding my appointments.

      - You have completely misunderstood my previous important question about [specific health topic], please try again.
      - This is a pretty useless automated service if the bot can't actually help with real user queries.
      - I definitely need much better and more personalised support than this current basic level of automation can provide.
      - Your MomConnect system reminders are now consistently coming on completely the wrong days for my actual appointments.
      - Why did the MomConnect service suddenly just stop sending all the helpful weekly messages to my registered phone number?
      - The MomConnect chatbot seems to be completely broken or at least malfunctioning quite badly for me today.
      - I rely heavily on this crucial health information I get from MomConnect, so it really needs to be accurate and up-to-date all the time without fail!
      - This is absolutely not the specific answer I was looking for or expecting from an official health support service like yours.
      - Is this bot even capable of handling complex user queries effectively? It really doesn't seem like it at the moment based on my experience.
      - MomConnect gives wrong answers.
      - Bot doesn't listen.
      - Repeating messages MomConnect.
      - Your chatbot is broken.
